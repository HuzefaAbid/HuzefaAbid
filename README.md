👋 Hi there! I’m a passionate full-stack web developer with a knack for crafting clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications. My expertise lies in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), but I’m always eager to explore new technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible.

🌐 Lately, I’ve been diving deep into **blockchain** and **Web3 development**, exploring how decentralized tech can reshape the internet. Smart contracts, dApps, and decentralized solutions—I'm here for it all.

💻 Whether it's building dynamic frontends, designing robust backends, or experimenting with blockchain integrations, I love bringing ideas to life through code. When I’m not coding, you can probably find me geeking out over the latest tech trends or contributing to open-source projects.

📬 Let’s connect! Whether you have a project idea, a collaboration in mind, or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out.
